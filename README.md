Some useful bookmarklets for school that I created.
# Usage
* Press "Copy" for the code of your choice.
* Create a bookmark.
* Enter any name of your choice.
* Type `javascript:` in the url box.
* Paste the code **after** `javascript:`.
* Press the bookmark to run it, might need to enable bookmarks bar first (Ctrl+Shift+B).
